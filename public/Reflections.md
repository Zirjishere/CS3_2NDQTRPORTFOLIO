# Reflection For CS3 1st Quarter
### By Zirjan Hero F. Mendaro

1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
* Arithmetic Operators - The operators used in js were very similar to C++ where we already discussed during grade 8. And in grade 8 this was used a lot for different activities.
* Comparison Operators - This operator was also similar to C++ because it had ==, !=, >, < signs which was already also discussed in grade 8. Also we had many excersises where we used them but while it was similar there were additions like strictly ===.
* Conditional Statements - Statements like if, if else, and else were also discussed in grade 8 for C++ so we had prior knowledge to how they worked. Also our project and excerse during grade 8 used a lot of conditional statements and also loop statements.
* Loop Statements - Same as conditional statements, do while , while, and for loops were discussed in grade 8. And was incorporated in many activities.
* Variable Declaration - C++ variable declaration was kind of similar to java script because of the same similar data types. Variable Declaration for javascript was just different because it used let, const, and var, while C++ used int.

2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
* Arrays - I can describe arrays but using them is confusing for some instances like switching info on one array to another and Etc.
* Nested Loops - Its confusing because the if statements might get tangled with each other and its kind of hard to debug so I end up redoing it which is why I need more practice on nested loops.
* Those are the only two I need practice/disccusions on even though they were kind of similar to grade 8 topics they are still tricky, while some topics are still confusing like functions, I can grasp them just fine because there familiar because of C++.

3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
* Doing more excersises during leisure time, Spending more time on relearning even after being taught in class so I can deepen my understanding and I will ask for help when I need to from others.

4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
* There wasn't any activity that was not effective. All activites given like excersises was helpful and effective to use in learning the lesson.
