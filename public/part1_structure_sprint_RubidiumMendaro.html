  <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <li>In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, water, minced garlic, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken and/or pork pieces to the marinade. Ensure all pieces are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
      <li>Heat cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade for later use.</li>
      <li>Brown the meat in the hot oil until all sides are golden brown. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the meat is browned, pour the reserved marinade into the skillet. Bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the meat is tender and cooked through.</li>
      <li>Occasionally stir and baste the meat with the sauce to enhance the flavor.</li>
      <li>Once the meat is tender, remove the lid and let the sauce simmer uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes to thicken it slightly.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy your delicious adobo!</li>
